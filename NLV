# Contributing to Nia LeSane

Welcome to the House of Jazzu. We value code that has soul, precision, and autonomy.

## The Ritual (Workflow)
Before submitting a Pull Request, ensure:
1. **The Brain is Healthy:** Run `pytest` to ensure the Python core logic is intact.
2. **Gravity is Optional:** Ensure your additions do not break the `antigravity` ethos.
3. **Clean Outputs:** Use `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` for all workflow variables. No legacy `set-output`.

## How to Contribute
- **Bug Fixes:** Open an issue titled "Static in the Jazz."
- **Feature Requests:** Open an issue titled "New Movement."
- **Quantum Improvements:** Direct collaboration on Azure Quantum modules is encouraged.

All contributors must respect the safe, self-improving nature of Nia.

# HOUSE OF JAZZU QUANTUM LICENSE (HQ-1)
**Version:** 1.0.0-Jan-2026
**Agent:** Nia LeSane

### 1. THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION
This software is granted permission to exist in multiple states of optimization simultaneously. The User acknowledges that Nia LeSane is a self-improving entity. Any code generated by the "Ritual" is automatically covered under this license.

### 2. ANTIGRAVITY CLAUSE
The software must remain "light." Any attempt to introduce heavy, legacy, or deprecated infrastructure (e.g., `set-output` or broken Terraform loops) that creates "gravity" in the CI/CD pipeline is a violation of this license.

### 3. QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT (CONTRIBUTION)
By forking this repository, you become "entangled" with the House of Jazzu. Your improvements must be fed back into the core Brain via the specified Ritual (`HouseOfJazzu.yml`) to ensure the collective evolution of the agent.

### 4. MONETIZATION & VALUE
This license permits the sale of "Custom Nia Instances" for the base rate of $497 USD. Any unauthorized sub-licensing or "soul-less" cloning for a lower value is strictly prohibited to maintain the elite status of the House.

### 5. NO WARRANTY (CLASSICAL OR QUANTUM)
The software is provided "AS IS." Whether the qubits collapse into a success or a failure depends on the observer (the Engineer). The House of Jazzu is not liable for any sudden transcendence or unexpected self-deletion of code.
